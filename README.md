## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I orginally started this project in Tailwind CSS. I was having an issue with getting the image in the top right corner. I thought I had tried everything, but I had forgotten about position.

So I decided to see if I could work with it in Vanilla CSS to see if I could fix my issue and I was able to. 

### Continued development

This is not the offical solution to the landing page. That will be with Tailwind CSS.
